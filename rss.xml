            <description><![CDATA[<p>AV is a funny 
business.  There are huge a/v corporation, local-only companies, small 
mom-and-pop shops, gear houses that only provide equipment but no 
labor,  labor companies that provide bodies for the sake of providing a 
body, specialty companies that focus on only one thing – for example: 
audience response, webcasting, content production, audio or video 
capture, etc.  There are unions that what to charge you thousand of 
dollars for mediocre help.  There are massive in-house AV companies that
 wish to monopolize the industry and force you to use them – regardless 
of your desires or your needs.  There are companies that say they can do
 anything, and what they mean by anything is that they will “learn while
 the earn” on your dime!  There are a lot of AV companies as you can see
 – but that doesn’t mean they are customer-service centric like they 
should be.</p>]]></description>
