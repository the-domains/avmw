AV is a funny 
business.  There are huge a/v corporation, local-only companies, small 
mom-and-pop shops, gear houses that only provide equipment but no 
labor,  labor companies that provide bodies for the sake of providing a 
body, specialty companies that focus on only one thing -- for example: 
audience response, webcasting, content production, audio or video 
capture, etc.  There are unions that what to charge you thousand of 
dollars for mediocre help.  There are massive in-house AV companies that
wish to monopolize the industry and force you to use them -- regardless 
of your desires or your needs.  There are companies that say they can do
anything, and what they mean by anything is that they will "learn while
the earn" on your dime!  There are a lot of AV companies as you can see
-- but that doesn't mean they are customer-service centric like they 
should be.

**And then there is us!**

We excel by focusing on customer service.  As we have said before and
we'll continue to say it -- "anyone can learn how to plug in a VGA cable
or connect a microphone".  However, only a few do it with a 
customer-centric focus.  We know that you need much more than renting AV
equipment.  You need clean-cut and polished technicians that get it and
understand that we are here to say "yes" and to say it with a smile.  
You need a partner that will listen to your needs and consult you on the
best possible solution.  You need a team player that is willing to do 
whatever it takes to keep you happy and to ensure your meeting is 
running to perfection.   You need a partner that believes in a fiduciary 
responsibility when working with you, that is not greedy and needy.  You
need a partner that is always going to find a solution for any problem 
you might have, anywhere in the world!

**You need AVMW!**

Let us show you what it's like to have a true AV partner that you can
count on.  We welcome any opportunity to show what makes us different 
from all the other AV companies out there.
